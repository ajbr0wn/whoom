# Character Decomposition Chat

This repository contains an experimental chat application that decomposes large language model (LLM) responses into distinct "characters" representing different perspectives. Users can select which characters to continue conversing with, creating branching conversations.

Development documentation can be found in [docs/development_plan.md](docs/development_plan.md).
